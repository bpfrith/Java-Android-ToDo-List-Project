To-Do List

Goal: Practice what we learned in the Java / Android weeks and research how to persist data.

MVP

You are required to write an Android app which will allow the user to maintain a task list. The user should be able to enter tasks and display them in a list. The list should only show the bare details of each task. Selecting a task from the list should bring up another screen which shows full details of the task. Users should also be able to mark tasks as completed.
